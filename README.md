# CS732/SE750 Demo - My Todo List

This project will contain a complete full-stack todo list app, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project is divided into [frontend](./frontend/) and [backend](./backend/) sub-folders.

Each video in the tutorial series will be associated with a `git` branch, containing the end-point of that video. The branches are as follows:

## Branches

1. **main:** The starting point for the project. The frontend is a stripped-down version of the starter React project created using `npm create vite@latest`. The backend is a barebones Node.js "Hello World" app with the reommended folder structure, but no content.

2. **step-1-displaying-todos:** In this step, we create some dummy data using ChatGPT, and then create a `<ul>` in `App.jsx`to display todo items in a list. We use JavaScript arrays' `map()` function to dynamically render a `<li>` for each todo item.
